How to update the niftilib webpage at SourceForge
-------------------------------------------------

The niftilib SF homepage is at
http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/

The documents for the niftilib webpage are at
/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs

This directory can be accessed directly/interactively
 by ssh'ing to the SF shell server 
shell.sourceforge.net

Files can be uploaded to this directory by using scp, e.g.:
scp index.html fissell@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs
Note that you only need to upload the 6 .html files listed
below, not everything in the webpage directory.


Currently the following 6 html files are stored in
CVS in the webpage module:

index.html
side.html
home.html
nifti1_overview.html
niftilib_overview.html
contacts.html


Note that the webpage also has the library API documents,
(C doxygen, Java javadoc).  These pages are not kept in
CVS b/c they can be autogenerated and change a lot.

To update the API documentation for the C libraries:

1. check out Clibs from CVS

2. Generate the API docs by:
   cd to the docs dir 
   doxygen ./Doxy_nifti.txt

3. scp the docs in the html directory that doxygen made to the 
   c_api_html webpage directory: 
   cd html
   scp * fissell@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs/c_api_html
4. Then, I would just delete the html dir
   cd ..
   rm -rf html
