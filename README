How to update the niftilib webpage at Github
-------------------------------------------------

The niftilib homepage is hosted from
https://github.com/NIFTI-Imaging/NIFTI-Imaging.github.io

Since 2007-06-26 the website uses a stylesheet to configure its look.
Most of the markup in the HTML was moved into the stylesheet. Additionally
all pages are now XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.

To update the API documentation for the C libraries:
1. check out Clibs

2. Generate the API docs by:
   cd to the docs dir 
   doxygen ./Doxy_nifti.txt

4. Then, delete the html dir
   cd ..
   rm -rf html
