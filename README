How to update the niftilib webpage at SourceForge
-------------------------------------------------

The niftilib SF homepage is at
http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/

The documents for the niftilib webpage are at
/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs

This directory can be accessed directly/interactively
 by ssh'ing to the SF shell server 
shell.sourceforge.net

Files can be uploaded to this directory by using scp, e.g.:
scp index.html  fissell,niftilib@web.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs
Note that you only need to upload the 8 files listed
below, not everything in the webpage directory.

Since 2007-06-26 the website uses a stylesheet to configure its look.
Most of the markup in the HTML was moved into the stylesheet. Additionally
all pages are now XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.

Currently the following 8 files are stored in
CVS in the webpage module:

index.html
side.html
home.html
nifti1_overview.html
niftilib_overview.html
contacts.html
debian.html
nifti.css

Note that the webpage also has the library API documents,
(C doxygen, Java javadoc).  These pages are not kept in
CVS b/c they can be autogenerated and change a lot.
Additionally the pics directory contains a binary file which is not in CVS.

To update the API documentation for the C libraries:

1. check out Clibs from CVS

2. Generate the API docs by:
   cd to the docs dir 
   doxygen ./Doxy_nifti.txt

3. scp the docs in the html directory that doxygen made to the 
   c_api_html webpage directory: 
   cd html
   scp * fissell,niftilib@web.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/n/ni/niftilib/htdocs/c_api2_html
4. Then, I would just delete the html dir
   cd ..
   rm -rf html
