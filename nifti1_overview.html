<h1><center>nifti-1 format overview</center></h1>

Information about the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI),
its Data Format Working Group (DFWG), and the nifti-1 format is available at the
<a href = "http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/">NIfTI</a> website.

<p>To quote the summary statement from the NIfTI website:
<blockquote>
"NIfTI-1 is a somewhat new data format, proposed by the NIfTI DFWG
as a short-term measure to facilitate inter-operation of functional
MRI data analysis software packages. It is adapted from the widely
used ANALYZE<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;7.5 file format. The hope is that
older non-NIfTI-aware software that uses the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5
format will still be compatible with NIfTI-1. NIfTI-1 uses the
"empty space" in the ANALYZE&nbsp;7.5 header to add several new
features. These features are summarized in the Sep 2003
presentation and OHBM abstract (linked to below)."
