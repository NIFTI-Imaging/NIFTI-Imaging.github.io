<blockquote>
Niftilib is a set of i/o libraries for reading and writing files in the 
<a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/dfwg">nifti-1</a>
data format. nifti-1 is a binary file format for storing medical image data,
e.g. magnetic resonance image (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) brain images.

<p>
Niftilib currently has C and Java libraries, we plan to add MATLAB code in the 
not too distant future. 

Niftilib code is released into the public domain, developers are encouraged
to incorporate niftilib code into their applications, and, to contribute
changes and enhancements to niftilib.

<p>
Note that niftilib is <i>one</i> implementation of an API for the nifti-1
file format.  The official nifti-1 format specification is separate from
this niftilib effort; the nifti-1 format specification specifies only the
file format, not an i/o API or any code implementations. 

<p>
<font color="red">niftilib is currently only in alpha development phase.  We hope
to release beta code by Feb 2005 and have a first production release shortly
thereafter.</font>
