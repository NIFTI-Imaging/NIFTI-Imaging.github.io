<blockquote>
Niftilib is a set of i/o libraries for reading and writing files in the 
<a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/dfwg">nifti-1</a>
data format. nifti-1 is a binary file format for storing medical image data,
e.g. magnetic resonance image (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) brain images.

<p>
Niftilib currently has C and Java libraries; we plan to add MATLAB code in the 
not too distant future. 


<p>
Niftilib has been developed by members of the NIFTI DFWG and serves as
a reference implementation of the nifti-1 file format.  In addition to 
being a reference implementation, we hope it is also a useful i/o library.
Niftilib code is released into the public domain, developers are encouraged
to incorporate niftilib code into their applications, and, to contribute
changes and enhancements to niftilib.  Please contact us if you would like
to contribute additonal functionality to the i/o library.

<p>
<font color="red">niftilib is currently only in alpha development phase.  We hope
to release beta code by March 2005 and have a first production release shortly
thereafter.</font>
